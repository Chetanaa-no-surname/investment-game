## Application Description

This is a browser-based, same-device multiplayer game where 2–4 players each allocate $100 between two assets:

- **Asset A (Riskless)**: The invested amount is returned in full.
- **Asset B (Pooled)**: Total contributions are pooled, increased by 50%, and split equally among all players regardless of contribution.

Players take turns at the same screen. Once all players have submitted, a results screen shows the full breakdown: Total pool, Boosted pool, Individual payouts and highlights the highest investment total among the players
